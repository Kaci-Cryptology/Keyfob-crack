In accordance with the Hitag-2 system scheme, we can express ks0 as a function of the following 20 input bits: ks0 = f(a2,a3,a5,a6,a8,a12,a14,a15,a17,a21,a23,a26,a28,a29,a31,a33,a34,a43,a44,a46).\n",

This algorithm will generate approximately 2^39 possible states of the LFSR that have generated the sequence ks0...ks8.
