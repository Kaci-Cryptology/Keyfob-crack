# Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of the DST40 cryptosystem, as well as a brute-force attack performed both on the central processing unit (CPU) and the graphics processing unit (GPU).

# Implementations

* `DST40.ipynb`: This file contains the DST40 algorithm and a CPU-based brute-force attack.
* `BruteForce-GPU.ipynb`: This file contains a GPU-based brute-force attack.
* `POC-key-recovery`: This file is a "Proof of Concept" demonstrating how the key can be recovered in less than an hour.

# Execution

To run the scripts:

# all necessary instructions are provided in the notebook itself. Simply follow the instructions provided there.
