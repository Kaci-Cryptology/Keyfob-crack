# Introduction

This repository provides a comprehensive description of the AUT64 cryptosystem, based on the study of several scientific articles. You can find this document in the same directory in PDF format. It also includes an implementation of the encryption/decryption algorithm as well as a brute-force attack.

# Implementations

* `AUT64_cryptanalysis.pdf`: This file provides a detailed description of the AUT64 system as well as its cryptanalysis.
* `AUT64_encrypt.py`: This file contains the implementation of the encryption algorithm.
* `AUT64_decrypt.py`: This file contains the implementation of the decryption algorithm.
* `AUT64-BruteForce.ipynb`: This file implements a brute-force attack on AUT64 in the case where the ID can be retrieved. Otherwise, the attack would take months to find the key.
* `XTEA_helpers`: This file is an implementation of the XTEA algorithm.

# Execution

To run the scripts:

# For the .ipynb files, all necessary instructions are provided in the notebook itself. Simply follow the instructions provided there.
# For the .py files, an example of execution is given at the end of the file.
